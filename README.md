-the second question is which types of gun is more popular.

## Tools

Anaconda
Package such as Numpy, Pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot
```
## Analysis Step

### Importing package

### Observe the data
-Utilized function such as head(), info(), and isnan() to observe the incorrect or the messy data. 

### Clean the data
-First, find the duplicate row and remove them. 
-Second, use a loop to calculate the average permit for each state 
-Third,Replace the Nan value with the average value for each state.
