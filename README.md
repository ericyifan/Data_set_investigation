# Gun Investigation

Gun topics always are the trend to investigate or explore. Gun is a dangerous subject which it can hurt people and protect people. To insured the citizen's safety, FBI had a system call NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) to record the gun data purchase and registration. The NICS can be used to determine if the buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives item. The firearm shops have access to pull out data from NICS and use the data to determined the eligibility for the buyer. The dataset contains numerical datas that revalent to the gun purchase and registration with state level.

## Task
-The first question in this project is which state had the highest overall gun registration/Permit. 
-the second question is which types of gun is more popular.

## Prerequisites

```
Anaconda
Package such as Numpy, Pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot
```


### Clean the data
First, I find the duplicate row and remove them. Then, use a loop to calculate the average permit for each state and replace the Nan value with the average.

### Visual

I create a bar graph for both question to provide more visual/clearly view of the solution.
